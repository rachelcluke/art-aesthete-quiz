# UI / Design Choices

## Moodboard

One of the first milestones of this project was to create a moodboard to help envision the overall house style of the webiite and ensure that all of the sections and elements are cohesive. The software I used to create the moodboard for this website is [Mila Note](https://milanote.com/ "Mila Note").
Below, is the moodboard:

## Colours

The colour scheme of the website is inspired by the moodboard (previously depicted). I have used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/ "coolers") to retrieve the desired colour codes and generate the colour palette.

Below, is the color palette:

## Breakpoints

As a starting point, I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the iPhone 5/SE (320px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are from [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap").

| Screen Size | Class Infix | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | none        | <576px     |
| small       | sm          | => 576px   |
| medium      | md          | => 768px   |
| large       | lg          | => 992px   |
| x-large     | xl          | => 1200px  |

## Wireframes

I have used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamiq") to develop my wireframes for my website. I initially created the mobile version and then the wireframes and then scaled it up for desktop. The website is a single page that is scrollable and displays/hides sections with logic in lieu of having multiple HTML pages to avoid inconvenient reloading of entire website.

The wireframes are below:
